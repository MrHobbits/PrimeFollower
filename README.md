# PrimeFollower
Prime Follower is a Twitter bot that checks a list of users' follower accounts to see if it is a prime number of not, if it is the bot notifies them.

##General Info
Python version: works with Python 3, currently using 3.8 with no problems
Modules: json, tweepy, logging, 

##History
I started this project because a user on twitter 
(@DHAhole) tweeted something to the lines of "I wish 
someone would make a bot that would let me know when 
my follower count was a prime number, so I could 
congratulate them for prime membership."

I saw this as a fun project that would both help me
understand python a bit more, and give me a chance to
interface with the Twitter API a bit.

What you see here is my very noob attempt at making my
first actual bot that does something.

I welcome anyone's suggestions on how to make this better,
as I'm sure I didn't do a lot of things in the most efficient
way. If you've got some suggestions or changes you'd like to
see feel free to let me know!

##Usage
If you want to run this on your own, you need to have Twitter developer API tokens
which are NOT included in this release (for security reasons, obv).

To add your own, you need to rename the blank_config.py to just config.py
and fill it in with your Twitter developer API tokens/keys.

After that, you need to make sure you have the tweepy module
installed (pip install tweepy)

If you need to message me I check GitHub often and will see your message.
